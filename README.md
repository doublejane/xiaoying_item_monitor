# xiaoying_item_monitor
A simple linux command-line script to monitor item information for "xiaoying" users

Run at linux shell

If a green color text appears, it means a fresh item has been just updated at XY website.

**If "Fatal ...." comes out by 10 times more, then you need to get another IP to run this script. A simple way to do this is to change the WAN port MAC address of your modem then re-dial it.
